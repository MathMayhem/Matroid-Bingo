# Matroid-Bingo
Matroids are a prolific type of set system which appears across mathematics and computer science. We are researching an equivalent description of these structures based around a simplified version of the popular board game Bingo. Our particular focus is in studying the probabilities of each card winning in this Bingo game which we have termed ``Beta Values''. This code demonstrates the algorithms we used for efficiently calculating these values.
